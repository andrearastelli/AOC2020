## Prompt 1

_Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up._

_Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together._

_For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:_

```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

_In this list, the two entries that sum to **2020** are **1721** and **299**. Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer is **`514579`**._

_Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to **2020**; what do you get if you multiply them together?_
